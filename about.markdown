All websites need an About-page, right? Well, here is mine.. üòÅ

So I'm a software engineer in Trondheim, Norway. I like open source software the best. And I frequently talk about that, to anyone who'll listen. In the daytime I paid to develop a corporate mobile app for my employer. It's not open source. But we _use_ a lot of open source. Like everyone else. And like most everyone else, we're not contributing back to it. Well, it's more complicated than that, but you get the drift.

I'm a huge fan of computer security, and therefore I sign my git commits.

This is my public key, you can use it if you want to send me something private. Or if you, like me, just prefer to communicate in private.

```text
<my private key, TBD>
```

This is another, maybe more convenient way to communicate with me, through the Signal app.
