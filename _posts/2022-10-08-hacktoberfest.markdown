So it's that time of year again! October means Hacktober, and Digital Ocean are following up previous years and sponsoring the event.

This year we will also engage in this celebration of open source, by arranging Hacktoberfest workshops, in Trondheim, Bergen and Oslo, and I get to host all of them! ðŸ˜…

I want to introduce all participants to contribute, by hosting a workshop where we first introduce open source and what it is, then why and how to contribute, and then get down to the work at hand, selecting good first issues, and making the actual contributions. Along the way, I've spiced up the presentation by showcasing a few inspiring projects.

I hope this can inspire the participants to get into contributing more on their own, but at the very least I want them to discover the open source community way of working.

So the events we are planning:

- [Trondheim, October 11th](https://www.meetup.com/gdg-trondheim/events/288791706/)
- [Bergen, October 18th](https://www.meetup.com/cloudnative-bergen/events/288818784/)
- Oslo, October 25th TBD
